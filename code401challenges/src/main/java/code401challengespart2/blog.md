## code challenge 26 Insertion Sort 

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

### Pseudocode
    DECLARE n <-- arr.Length; 
    FOR i = 0; i to n - 1  
        DECLARE min <-- i; 
        FOR j = i + 1 to n 
            if (arr[j] < arr[min]) 
                min <-- j; 
 
        DECLARE temp <-- arr[min]; 
        arr[min] <-- arr[i]; 
        arr[i] <-- temp;  
        
### Trace
Sample Array: [8,4,23,42,16,15]
