# Graph
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods

## Challenge

1. AddNode()
- Adds a new node to the graph
- Takes in the value of that node
- Returns the added node

2.AddEdge()
- Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
- Include the ability to have a “weight”
- Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
- Both nodes should already be in the Graph

3.GetNodes()
- Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
- GetNeighbors()
- Returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node
- Takes in a given node
- Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection

4.Size()
- Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

## Approach & Efficiency
I created Edge and Graph class. I stored the key value set in hashmap.
